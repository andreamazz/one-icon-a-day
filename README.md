#One icon a day
As stated in this [blog post](http://andreamazz.github.io/blog/2014/12/16/new-years-resolution/), I'll be designing an icon a day, from January 1 2015 to December 31 2015. 
The icons will be designed with [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com/) and provided as SVG and PNG files alongside the Sketch source. 

I'll be using a randomly generated word. If you have requests, by all means, open an issue and I'll see if I can design it.
