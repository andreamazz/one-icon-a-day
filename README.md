#One icon a day
I'll be designing an icon a day, from January 1 2015 to December 31 2015. 
The icons will be designed with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and provided as SVG and PNG files alongside the Sketch source. 

I'll be using a randomly generated word. If you have requests, by all means, open an issue and I'll see if I can design it.
